Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished.
What are the reasons and what measures can be taken to tackle
this problem

NEW Word



Recidivism has emerged as a significant concern in many nations. 
This essay explores the reasons behind this trend and suggests 
some effective solutions to address it.

Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. One reason 
is that ex-convicts, after being released, are burdened with 
a criminal record, which can prevent them from securing 
employment opportunities, as most companies remain hesitant 
to hire former prisoners. The financial struggles that result 
from such limited opportunities can drive some individuals 
to re- engage in criminal activities to cover their living 
expenses. Another factor contributing to this issue is that 
some individuals with mental health conditions, such as 
antisocial personality disorder or aggressive tendencies,
may, upon release, struggle to control their impulses and may 
find themselves drawn back into a life of crime.

To tackle this issue, a comprehensive approach is needed. 
Firstly, it is advisable for the government to create new 
employment opportunities specifically designed for former 
offenders to facilitate their reintegration. This would help 
ensure their financial stability and provide them with motivation 
to rebuild their lives. Additionally, the government can combat 
societal prejudice through various media campaigns to raise 
public awareness about the importance of respecting and 
supporting the reintegration of former prisoners, thereby 
fostering a more inclusive and welcoming environment. Finally, 
to address mental health issues, prisons should implement 
rehabilitation programs and therapy sessions to help treat 
underlying psychological conditions.

In conclusion, the problem of increased recidivism can be 
attributed to both individual and societal factors. To address 
this issue effectively, each nation needs a holistic approach 
that includes job creation, anti-discrimination campaigns, and 
a stronger focus on mental health treatment programs in prisons.
