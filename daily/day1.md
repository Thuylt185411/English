1
00:00:07   --> 00:00:12  
You're in the middle of a project when suddenly moving forward seems impossible.
2
00:00:12   --> 00:00:14  
Maybe you don't know what the next step is.
3
00:00:14   --> 00:00:18  
Or perhaps you’ve faced setbacks, and you’re starting to think,
4
00:00:18   --> 00:00:20  
“what’s even the point?”
5
00:00:20   --> 00:00:23  
Many of us have experienced feeling stuck.
6
00:00:23   --> 00:00:27  
It can happen when tackling something as simple as a term paper,
7
00:00:27   --> 00:00:32  
or as monumental as social inequality or the climate crisis.
8
00:00:32   --> 00:00:34  
So, are there ways to get unstuck?
9
00:00:34   --> 00:00:37  
People often report feeling highly motivated
10
00:00:37   --> 00:00:40  
at the start and end of a project,
11
00:00:40   --> 00:00:43  
but the middle can feel untethered.
12
00:00:43   --> 00:00:46  
Psychologists call this the “stuck in the middle” effect,
13
00:00:46   --> 00:00:49  
and it’s thought to be caused by a shift in perspective that happens
14
00:00:49   --> 00:00:51  
as you move closer to your goals.
15
00:00:51   --> 00:00:56  
When you start working towards something, any progress can feel like a win,
16
00:00:56   --> 00:00:59  
as we tend to compare ourselves against where we started.
17
00:00:59   --> 00:01:02  
For example, when someone starts training for a marathon,
18
00:01:02   --> 00:01:06  
accomplishing even a short jog can feel motivating.
19
00:01:06   --> 00:01:08  
But the longer you work on something,
20
00:01:08   --> 00:01:13  
the more likely it is that your focus shifts to your end goal.
21
00:01:13   --> 00:01:17  
In other words, rather than seeing how far you've come,
22
00:01:17   --> 00:01:21  
it’s easy to become frustrated by how far you still need to go.
23
00:01:21   --> 00:01:26  
A simple way to avoid these motivational sinkholes is to break your pursuits
24
00:01:26   --> 00:01:29  
into smaller, more achievable sub-goals.
25
00:01:29   --> 00:01:34  
This creates less daunting, incremental benchmarks to compare your progress to.
26
00:01:34   --> 00:01:39  
It also creates more opportunities to celebrate wins along the way.
27
00:01:39   --> 00:01:45  
This is especially important when working towards bigger societal goals.
28
00:01:45   --> 00:01:49  
These issues are, by nature, large-scale and complex—
29
00:01:49   --> 00:01:52  
no single action or person is likely to solve them.
30
00:01:52   --> 00:01:58  
So if you only focus on the end goal, it’s easy to feel personally powerless.
31
00:01:58   --> 00:02:02  
And the enormity of these problems may be why so many people,
32
00:02:02   --> 00:02:05  
including those who care deeply about the issues,
33
00:02:05   --> 00:02:10  
think that progress is impossible, leading them to disengage.
34
00:02:10   --> 00:02:14  
In fact, one 2021 global survey of young people
35
00:02:14   --> 00:02:18  
found that over half believe humanity is doomed.
36
00:02:18   --> 00:02:20  
But despite these obstacles,
37
00:02:20   --> 00:02:26  
some people do manage to stay motivated, engaged, and unstuck.
38
00:02:26   --> 00:02:28  
So, how do they do it?
39
00:02:28   --> 00:02:32  
Surprisingly, it’s not all about how concerned you are
40
00:02:32   --> 00:02:34  
or how much you care about the issue in front of you.
41
00:02:34   --> 00:02:38  
For instance, research has found that among those who feel the most alarmed
42
00:02:38   --> 00:02:40  
about climate change,
43
00:02:40   --> 00:02:43  
only about a third take regular climate action.
44
00:02:43   --> 00:02:48  
However, a unifying factor among those who do take action
45
00:02:48   --> 00:02:52  
is the confidence that their personal involvement could make a difference.
46
00:02:52   --> 00:02:55  
And this belief isn't misguided.
47
00:02:55   --> 00:02:59  
The long history of social progress proves that change is possible.
48
00:02:59   --> 00:03:03  
And individual actions— whether it’s volunteering, voting, protesting,
49
00:03:03   --> 00:03:06  
or personally contributing to a communal goal—
50
00:03:06   --> 00:03:09  
are key to building the collective momentum
51
00:03:09   --> 00:03:13  
that has tackled seemingly impenetrable issues.
52
00:03:13   --> 00:03:16  
It’s not to say that concern and passion have no place.
53
00:03:16   --> 00:03:21  
Moral outrage, or anger, can help us focus on what’s at stake.
54
00:03:21   --> 00:03:25  
And when it’s correctly harnessed, outrage can be a powerful unifier.
55
00:03:25   --> 00:03:30  
In the American Civil Rights Movement, shared anger over systemic racism,
56
00:03:30   --> 00:03:33  
injustice, and violence against Black people
57
00:03:33   --> 00:03:37  
galvanized diverse communities to work together in the fight for equality.
58
00:03:37   --> 00:03:41  
And bringing together people of different backgrounds and mindsets
59
00:03:41   --> 00:03:45  
 is essential to building longevity and resilience in any movement.
60
00:03:45   --> 00:03:49  
In this way, thinking about how you can apply your own unique perspective,
61
00:03:49   --> 00:03:54  
knowledge, and expertise to promoting change can be helpful.
62
00:03:54   --> 00:03:57  
And finding community has plenty of other benefits.
63
00:03:57   --> 00:04:01  
Just witnessing other people at work has been shown to motivate personal action,
64
00:04:01   --> 00:04:04  
creating a positive feedback loop.
65
00:04:04   --> 00:04:07  
Collaboration can help you better problem solve
66
00:04:07   --> 00:04:09  
when you’re unsure what the next step is.
67
00:04:09   --> 00:04:11  
And the support and encouragement of others
68
00:04:11   --> 00:04:14  
can serve as a source of inspiration and joy
69
00:04:14   --> 00:04:18  
if you’re feeling exhausted, defeated, or stuck.
70
00:04:18   --> 00:04:23  
The path to conquering any goal is long and bound to hit sticking points.
71
00:04:23   --> 00:04:26  
Often, the best way to get unstuck is just to take any action,
72
00:04:26   --> 00:04:30  
no matter how small or imperfect the outcome.
73
00:04:30   --> 00:04:34  
Progress starts with writing that next sentence, running that extra mile,
74
00:04:34   --> 00:04:36  
or even casting that vote to build a better future.
