Using Tech to Teach — Smartly

Ben Cogswell, a kindergarten teacher in Salinas, Calif., makes creative online videos to educate
his students during the pandemic. His robot puppet is named Bot, and from Texas.
Many teachers, children and caregivers who have to depend on technology for distance learning
these days are miserable.
Ben Cogswell, a kindergarten teacher in Salinas, Calif., has nailed it. And he has some advice for the rest of us.
For his remote classes, Cogswell breaks out a robot puppet for videos that get his students primed for the day. He sings an alphabet song to guide kids through a lesson on commonly
mixed-up letters. In the evening, he reads stories over Facebook Live, sometimes with his wife accompanying him on the ukulele.
While living through screens can largely feel like a mess, talking to Cogswell was a happy
reminder that technology — if we keep it in its place — can empower creative teachers to shine
and help students learn through a tough time.
His experience could help all of us try to focus on making our personalities, not the technology,
take center stage.
Cogswell is more tech savvy than most educators — than most people, period. But he said that
what has worked best for him has been limiting both tech and complexity.
Rather than requiring parents to deal with multiple new pieces of software, Cogswell uses two:
Google Meet for live virtual classes and Seesaw for students to post their online assignments or
drawings.
Cogswell also has a relatively simple, predictable schedule, with class days starting with his
five-to-10-minute videos, followed by two chunks of group classes. “I try to make it really
consistent and doable for the kids and their parents,” he said.
Cogswell said he believed that limiting the technology and the transitions from one lesson to
another has kept his students’ participation rate high, despite their home challenges. He said his
students come from families that have relatively low incomes and may only speak Spanish.
I initially called Cogswell for dirt, basically, on where technology companies were falling short
for teachers in a pandemic. Cogswell mostly had compliments.

He was pleased with new Google safety measures to secure video classes from intrusions, and a
recent feature that lets all the kids see each other at once in mini camera shots. He also said it
was helpful that Seesaw started hosting live help sessions for teachers.
He said, however, that companies that publish textbooks and other classroom materials haven’t
adapted well. He’s instead made much of his own coursework. To teach about the butterfly life
cycle, for example, Cogswell shot a time-lapse video of caterpillars transitioning into
butterflies.
You can feel Cogswell’s enthusiasm. He talked with pride about winning a local teaching
award, and about other teachers adapting his lessons for their virtual classrooms. As we chatted,
he occasionally slipped into explaining-kindergarten-teacher mode. I didn’t mind one bit.
Like many of the families in his class, Cogswell is juggling. He has four children at home, his
wife is studying to become a music teacher, and they’re planning to upgrade their house.
“Every day is go go go,” he said. “‘It’s good I’m passionate about what I do.”

Speaking of kids stuck at home …
When the pandemic forced the international law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster to go all remote,
Janet Stone Herman’s job changed in a flash.
Stone Herman, who leads the firm’s development and women’s leadership efforts, used to focus
on performance evaluations, professional development and parental leave policies. Not now.
She recently started what turned out to be popular online seminars with a family therapist for
the firm’s roughly 3,000 employees.
“Under the best of circumstances when you’re a parent and have a full-time job, it’s hard,” she
said. “You take away that support network and throw everyone in the house together, and you
have to be the principal, tutor and babysitter …”
She didn’t need to finish the sentence.
Most workplaces don’t have the resources of a large law firm. But it was interesting to hear how
thoughtful the firm has been about offering practical help and support.
The seminars have tackled employees’ questions about managing their children’s tantrums,
struggles with remote learning and disappointments about missing summer camp and
milestones like proms. Another focused on the struggles of employees who are home alone and
feeling isolated.

Stone Herman said a surprising benefit of the pandemic work-life juggle is that some of the
workplace hierarchies have melted away. Big bosses seem less intimidating when their kid is
bouncing a beach ball off their head in a Zoom work meeting.
“People are so much more sympathetic across the board and see each other as human beings
first,” she said. “I’m hoping that sticks.”
